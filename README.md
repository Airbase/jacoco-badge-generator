The jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action parses a `jacoco.csv` from a JaCoCo coverage report,
computes coverage percentages from [JaCoCo's Instructions and Branches counters](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html), and 
generates badges for one or both of these (configurable with action inputs) to provide an easy 
to read visual summary of the code coverage of your test cases.

_The developers of the jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action are not affiliated 
with the developers of JaCoCo, although we are a fan and user of their excellent 
test coverage tool._ 

The documentation is organized into the following sections:
* [The Coverage Metrics](#the-coverage-metrics): Explains the JaCoCo metrics that are supported by the badge generator, such as what they measure, and why they were chosen for inclusion for the jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action.
* [Badge Style and Content](#badge-style-and-content): Provides examples of the appearance of the badges that are generated, including a description of the color scheme used, and the formatting of the percentages.
* [Inputs](#inputs): Detailed descriptions of the action inputs.
* [Outputs](#outputs): Detailed descriptions of the action inputs.
* [Example Workflows](#example-workflows): Example GitHub workflows demonstrating usage of the jacoco-badge-generator action.


## The Coverage Metrics

The jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action currently supports generating badges for 
the two primary coverage metrics generated by JaCoCo: Instructions (C0 Coverage), and 
Branches (C1 Coverage). Here is a summary of what these compute and why they were chosen
for inclusion by this badge generator.

### Instructions Coverage (C0 Coverage)

The default behavior of the badge generator is to generate only the Instructions Coverage
badge, which is labeled on the badge simply as "coverage". JaCoCo 
measures [C0 Coverage](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html)
from the Java bytecode instructions in the compiled `.class` files. One of the advantages
to counting the byte-code instructions executed or missed, rather than lines of source code, 
is that it is independent of coding style and formatting. As a simple example, consider
the sequence of Java statements to swap the values in two 
variables: `int temp = a; a = b; b = temp;`.  A line counter will count this as 1 line if
written on a single line, or 3 lines if each statement is written on its own line. However,
JaCoCo's instructions counter treats these two cases as equivalent since they compile
to the same bytecode. Consider a more complex example of calling a method while passing a simple
value, such as `foo(5)` versus passing the result of a calculation to the method, such as
`foo(2.0 + bar/11.0)`. Line counting considers both of these as 1 line; while the second case
will factor in more heavily into JaCoCo's instruction counting than will the first case. For
these reasons, although JaCoCo also provides line coverage data, we do not currently support
generating a badge from JaCoCo's line counter data.  

### Branches Coverage (C1 Coverage)

The badge generator also optionally supports generating a badge for Branches Coverage
(or C1 Coverage), with the generated badge labeled as "branches".  See 
the [inputs](#inputs) section for a description of the action
inputs.  JaCoCo 
measures [C1 Coverage or Branches Coverage](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html)
from the Java bytecode in the compiled `.class` files, so the result may be a bit
different than what you might expect from branch coverage. At first, you may even mistakenly
guess that it is counting conditions (C2 coverage) rather than branches, but it is counting
branches (in bytecode rather than in source code). Consider this example to illustrate
the difference: `if (a && b) foo(); else bar();`. If we count branches in source code,
there are 2 branches, which would require a minimum of two tests for full coverage, one where
both `a` and `b` are `true`, and a second test where at least one of them is `false`.
If we instead count conditions, there are 4 conditions (`a==true`, `a==false`, `b==true`, 
`b==false`), which can be covered with as few as two tests (e.g., `a==true` and `b==false`
as test one, and `b==true` and `a==false` as test two), without actually covering both
branches. JaCoCo's branches counter is neither of these. JaCoCo's branches counter
counts branches in the Java bytecode. What does that mean for this example? Imagine instead
that the if statement above was written as a pair of nested if 
statements: `if (a) { if (b) { foo(); } else { bar(); } } else { bar(); }`. There are
a total of 4 branches in this case (and is essentially what JaCoCo would count as branches).
To cover all 4 branches would require a minimum of 3 test cases: one where `a` and `b` are both
`true`, one in which `a` is `true` and `b` is `false`, and a third where `a` is `false` and `b`'s 
value doesn't matter. In this way, JaCoCo's branches counter leads to a stronger form
of C1 Coverage than is usually implied by branches coverage.


## Badge Style and Content

The badges that are generated are inspired by the style of the badges 
of [Shields.io](https://github.com/badges/shields), however, the badges are entirely generated
within the jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action, with no external calls.  Here are
a few samples of what the badges look like:
* ![Coverage 100%](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/blob/main/tests/100.svg) We use bright green for 100% coverage.
* ![Coverage 99.9%](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/blob/main/tests/999.svg) We use green for coverage from 90% up through 99.9%.
* ![Coverage 80%](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/blob/main/tests/80.svg) We use yellow green for coverage from 80% up through 89.9%.
* ![Coverage 70%](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/blob/main/tests/70.svg) We use yellow for coverage from 70% up through 79.9%.
* ![Coverage 60%](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/blob/main/tests/60.svg) We use orange for coverage from 60% up through 69.9%.
* ![Coverage 59.9%](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/blob/main/tests/599.svg) We use red for coverage from 0% up through 59.9%.
* ![Branches Coverage 99.9%](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator/blob/main/tests/999b.svg) A sample of a branch coverage badge.

The coverage displayed in the badge is the result of truncating to one 
decimal place.  If that decimal place is 0, then it is displayed as an 
integer.  The rationale for truncating to one decimal place, rather than 
rounding is to avoid displaying a just failing coverage as passing. For
example, if the user of the action considers 80% to be a passing level,
then we wish to avoid the case of 79.9999% being rounded to 80% (it will
instead be truncated to 79.9%).  


## Inputs

All inputs include default values, and are thus optional provided the
defaults are relevant to your use-case.

### `jacoco-csv-file`

This input is the full path, relative to the root of the repository, to 
the `jacoco.csv` file, including filename.  It defaults 
to `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.csv`, which is the default location and filename
assuming you are using the JaCoCo Maven plugin and don't change the default
output location.

### `badges-directory`

This input is the directory for storing badges, relative to the root of the 
repository. The default is `.github/badges`. The action will create the badges
directory if it doesn't already exist, although the action itself does not commit.

### `coverage-badge-filename`

This input is the filename for the coverage badge. The default filename 
is `jacoco.svg`. The file format is an `svg`. The badge file will be 
created within the `badges-directory`
directory. __The action doesn't commit the badge file. You will 
need to have additional steps in your workflow to do that.__

### `branches-badge-filename`

This input is the filename for the branches coverage badge. The default filename 
is `branches.svg`. The file format is an `svg`. The badge file will be 
created within the `badges-directory`
directory. __The action doesn't commit the badge file. You will 
need to have additional steps in your workflow to do that.__

### `generate-coverage-badge`

This input controls whether or not to generate the overall coverage badge, and defaults
to `true`.

### `generate-branches-badge`

This input controls whether or not to generate the branches coverage badge, and defaults
to `false`. This defaults to `false` to avoid surprising users who upgrade from earlier
versions with a badge they didn't know would be generated.

### `jacoco-badge-file` __DEPRECATED__

__This input is DEPRECATED.__ You should instead use the combination of 
the `badges-directory` and `coverage-badge-filename` inputs. This input 
will be removed in the next release, and has been retained only to ease 
transition from earlier versions of this GitHub Action. If this input is 
used it takes precedence over the new `badges-directory` 
and `coverage-badge-filename` inputs. This input is the full path, relative 
to the root of the repository, to the created coverage badge, including 
filename. This defaults to the empty string. Note that if you were using 
the old default value for this input in prior versions, then you should be all
set with the default values for the new pair of replacement inputs.


## Outputs

The action also outputs the actual computed coverage percentages as double-precision
floating-point numbers. So you can add a step to your workflow to access these if 
desired (these action outputs are values in the interval from 0.0 to 1.0).

### `coverage`

This output is the actual computed coverage percentage in the interval 
from 0.0 to 1.0.  This is overall coverage computed from the instruction
coverage data in the JaCoCo csv report.

### `branches`

This output is the actual computed branches coverage percentage 
in the interval from 0.0 to 1.0.  This is the percentage of branches
covered, computed from the branches data in the JaCoCo csv report.


## Example Workflows

### Prerequisite: Running JaCoCo

This example workflow assumes that you are using Maven to build and test
a Java project, and that you have the `jacoco-maven-plugin`
configured in your `pom.xml` in the test phase with something
along the lines of the following:

```XML
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
      <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>0.8.6</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
        <execution>
          <id>generate-code-coverage-report</id>
          <phase>test</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>report</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
      </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

### Example Workflow 1: Generate overall coverage badge only.

This sample workflow runs on pushes to the main
branch.  It first sets up Java, and runs the tests with Maven. If you
have JaCoCo configured to run during the test phase, this will also
produce the JaCoCo reports.  The jacoco-badge-generator action is then
run to parse the `jacoco.csv`, compute the coverage percentage, and
generate the badge.  The coverage percentage is then logged in the
workflow so you can inspect later if necessary. The next step of the workflow
checks if any changes were made to the badge, and if so, does a commit and a push (note
that there are also GitHub Actions that you can use for that step). And 
finally, the JaCoCo coverage reports are uploaded as a workflow
artifact using the [actions/upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)
GitHub Action, so you can inspect them if necessary.

```yml
name: build

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up JDK 1.11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: 1.11

    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn -B test

    - name: Generate JaCoCo Badge
      id: jacoco
      uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v1.2.1

    - name: Log coverage percentage
      run: |
        echo "coverage = ${{ steps.jacoco.outputs.coverage }}"
        echo "branch coverage = ${{ steps.jacoco.outputs.branches }}"

    - name: Commit the badge (if it changed)
      run: |
        if [[ `git status --porcelain` ]]; then
          git config --global user.name 'YOUR NAME HERE'
          git config --global user.email 'YOUR-GITHUB-USERID@users.noreply.github.com'
          git add -A
          git commit -m "Autogenerated JaCoCo coverage badge"
          git push
        fi

    - name: Upload JaCoCo coverage report
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: jacoco-report
        path: target/site/jacoco/
```

### Example Workflow 2: Generate overall coverage and branches coverage badges.

This example workflow is just like the above example, however, it generates
both badges (overall coverage percentage and branches coverage percentage).

```yml
name: build

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up JDK 1.11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: 1.11

    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn -B test

    - name: Generate JaCoCo Badge
      id: jacoco
      uses: cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator@v1.2.1
      with:
        generate-branches-badge: true

    - name: Log coverage percentage
      run: |
        echo "coverage = ${{ steps.jacoco.outputs.coverage }}"
        echo "branch coverage = ${{ steps.jacoco.outputs.branches }}"

    - name: Commit the badge (if it changed)
      run: |
        if [[ `git status --porcelain` ]]; then
          git config --global user.name 'YOUR NAME HERE'
          git config --global user.email 'YOUR-GITHUB-USERID@users.noreply.github.com'
          git add -A
          git commit -m "Autogenerated JaCoCo coverage badge"
          git push
        fi

    - name: Upload JaCoCo coverage report
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: jacoco-report
        path: target/site/jacoco/
```
